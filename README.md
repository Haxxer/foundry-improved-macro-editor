# Improved Macro Editor add-on for Foundry VTT

This module alters the macro editor. 

It makes the editor window larger by default, the size can be selected from a couple of options in the module settings.

It also enhances the operation of the editor itself:

- Syntax highlighting
- Preserves indentation on a new line
- Adds closing brackets, quotes
- Indents lines and blocks with the Tab key and unindents using Shift-Tab
- A block comment hot key can be bound in keyboard controls, which toggles the selected line(s) between commented and uncommented

The editor itself is based on [CodeJar](https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar) with some extensions by me.
